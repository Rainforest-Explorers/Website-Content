Thinking of those who have limited time in Arenal or simply want to enjoy most of this wonderful area, we have designed an outstanding combination to explore the best of the volcano surrounding wonders.
Penas Blancas river will welcome you with a great morning Safari Float surrounded by its lush vegetation, although animals are umpredictable to find, the river side is a great chance to see wildlife, it is very common to find monkeys, sloths, birds, lizards, and some other interesting creatures.

After the float, we will head towards the second exciting activity, La Fortuna Waterfall, a place where forest and a big cascade will provide a breathtaking scenery. For those who enjoy swimming and dipping this is the best chance.

Lunch time has come just in time, around 1:30pm we will be visiting a local family for lunch, a very tasty fresh typical lunch is served in an open air area where you can enjoy the sounds of the biodiversity around. Costa Rican coffee is offered after lunch for those who enjoy a cup of good coffee.

Later, we will start a very informative hike at the famous Arenal Volcano National Park, along the hike you will learn about history, activity of the volcano, eruptions that marked people and the community, as well as you will have the best view at the base of the volcano. Some wildlife may be found along the walk.

The day has gone with unforgettable memories and sceneries in your mind, we will be taking you back to your hotel from 6:00pm to 6:30pm.
